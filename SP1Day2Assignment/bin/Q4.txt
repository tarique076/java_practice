Q4/-Explain about the ORM, what are the benefits of the ORM approach over the
JDBC approach.

--> The process of mapping the Java classes with the database tables, Java class member variables with the database table
columns and making the object of the Java class represents the DB table records having synchronization between them is
called a OR mapping.

The benefits of ORM approach over JDBC approach are as follows:- 
1. It can persist/store java obj to the DB directly.
2. It supports POJO and POJI model
3. It is a lightweight s/w becoz to excute the ORM based application we need not install any kind of servers.
4. ORM persistence logic is DB independent. it is portable across multiple DB s/ws.
(because here we deal with object, not with the SQL queries)
5. Prevent the developers from boiler plate code coding to perform CRUD operations.
6. It generates fine tuned SQL statements internally that improves the performance.
7. it provides caching mechanism (maintaining one local copy to enhance the performance)
8. It provides implicit connection pooling.
9. Exception handling is optional because it throws unchecked exceptions.
10. it has a special Query language called JPQL (JPA query language ) that totally depends upon the objects.
